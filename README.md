# CS50x-FINAL-PROJECT-Games-Track

Hi, everyone my name is Brenda Caliskanalp residing in Singapore and I'm a 2020 CS50x student.
For my final project, I created this simple game using Lua and Love and I named it Love Not Hate.
This is a 2-player game represented by 2 unicorns as my sprites, wherein 1 is considered  a 'good' one(the normal-looking unicorn) and the other one (who is posed like scaring someone) is the bad character in our game.Basically the mechanics of the game is that the bad one would have to chase the good one around within the duration of 60 seconds(as shown on the upper left timer).How to move the sprites is by pressing the 'right', 'left', 'up', 'down' keys for the good unicorn, and the keys 'w', 'a', 's' and 'x' for the bad unicorn.
Once the bad unicorn collides with the good one, as indicated by a sound, it means game is over and unfortunately 'hate' wins. However, if the time ends and the bad unicorn fails to collide with the other, symbolically, love wins over hate.If the player/s wish/es to play again, he/she can do so by simply making the characters move again by pressing the keys mentioned above.  
On the other hand, how to quit is simply by pressing the 'escape' key.

By the way, this is purely a game and this does not connote any personal, racial, religion, social et al issues.
I chose unicorn as the image simply because I find it cute enough to be the graphic characters of my game.
